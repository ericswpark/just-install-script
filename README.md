# Caveats

#### Arduino

Arduino might prompt Windows to display driver warnings. You need to allow them for installation to continue.

#### PotPlayer

PotPlayer will have a pop-up during installation that does not require user input but is annoying nevertheless.

#### VeraCrypt

VeraCrypt does not have a silent option (dammit) so you need to click through the installer.

# To-dos
 - Run directly from GitHub repository, like just-install does with msiexec.exe
 - Or maybe PowerShell?
 - Dammit, make installation as easy as possible by adding a button to the README
 - Externalize program list in text file or something
